# SQL-Projects
##Project Guidelines 
Students will work in a team to develop a database, which will be applied in an organization of their choice 
(i.e. retail business, health sector, insurance, finance, travel industry, and so forth). 
• The conceptual schema should be comprised of at least four to ten tables. Depending on the system requirements, additional tables maybe included within the database. 
• Students are to insert sample data into the tables to be able to perform the necessary transactions related to the field of business. 
• Students are to create ten queries to select information according to specific criteria as discussed within the class sessions 
(e.g. aggregate functions, regular expressions, subqueries, exists, views and so forth).
 The selection of queries presented should be related to the domain of the business.
